  <h1>55+ Memories & Things We Love About You</h1>
  <p class="memories-intro">
    We asked the grandkids to share a memory, a small moment, or something
    they love about you. Here are their words.
  </p>

  <section>
    <h2>From Addie</h2>
    <p>When Dad says something goofy that gets Mom laughing really hard.</p>
    <p>When Mom says “Oh Von” in a really annoyed voice.</p>
    <p>When Dad calls Mom “songbird” and she rolls her eyes.</p>
    <p>Even boating close by was so fun.</p>
    <p>Those western plays in Jackson Hole.</p>
    <p>They are so into their grandkids, every single one individually.</p>
    <p>You try to keep up with everyone and everything.</p>
    <p>They care to their core.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>From Heather</h2>
    <p>When Dad took us to Lake Powell.</p>
    <p>How much you love being grandparents.</p>
    <p>When you wrote a song about all the grandkids.</p>
    <p>Dad waits in the car while Mom goes shopping.</p>
    <p>And he calls one of us while he’s waiting.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>From Megan</h2>
    <p>You call and check on each other all the time.</p>
    <p>The Valentine’s Day box Dad made for Mom.</p>
    <p>Building foam block towers for the kids to knock down.</p>
