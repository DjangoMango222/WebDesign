        This book is about a local journalist by the name of Rune most often. For a long night, a tough time, a celebration; this book is much more than meets the eye. 
        At first I thought this book was about crime but then I delve and what I found is that this piece of literature does not skip a beat. The relation's within this book really 
        showcase the ability of Jeffery Deaver adding yet another book to his collections of gems.
