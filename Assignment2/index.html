    <h3>Chapter 1</h3>
    <p>
      Rune had walked past the movie theater and was three blocks away when the bomb went off.
      No way was it construction-site dynamite — she knew that from living for several years 
      in urban-renewing Manhattan. The noise was way loud — a huge, painful bang like a falling boiler. 
      The turbulent black smoke and distant screams left no doubt.

    <p>
      Then sirens, shouts, running crowds. She looked but couldn’t see much from where she stood.
      Rune started toward it but then stopped, glanced at a watch — of the three on her wrist, it was the only one that worked. 
      She was already late getting back to the studio — was due a half hour ago. Thinking: Hell, if I’m going to get yelled at anyway 
      why not come back with a good story to take the sting out of it.

      Yes, no?<br>
      Go for it. She walked south to see the carnage.

      The cold air bit at the skin beneath the collar of Lincoln Rhyme's coat. 
      The crime scene stretched before him, silent but screaming in clues. 
      Every detail was a puzzle piece, every shadow a whisper of the killer's mind. 
      The blue movie star's death was no accident—it was a message written in blood.
