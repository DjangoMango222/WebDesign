## What did you like about Flexbox and Grid?

<p>
What I like most about flexbox and grid is it allows the user to organize data in a simplified way, rather than creating positioning and later on margining we can just use a .div class as well as a flexbox. The div will seperate the data from other data, meanwhile the flexbox organizes the data I want as described within my .css. This makes for a really easy and simplified way of placing things on your website!

### How do you think they might streamline your workflow or make future projects easier?

<p>
When working with Flexbox and grid I almost think of them as file folders as they hold data like a folder. Having flexbox and grid layouts already created makes for an easy acquisition of these assets if you wanted to reuse them in another website or keep the formatting and just change the data! Flex box or grid really allow for plug and play making website creation a lot more simple and less complex.

#### Which layout method do you prefer so far, and why?
<p>
My go to lay out is using rows and columns when I am using grid but when I use Flex box I use it for organizing things like a nav bar as it makes things look neat and organized spacing everything evenly.
