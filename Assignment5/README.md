# Short reflection

For this Assignment I really wanted to give it my all to personalize it and make it my own. I drew up a markup for what I wanted my site to look like and then hit the books. I generated most of the text I wanted to use to save time getting everything together, altogether I think the site is very well put together. This took me what feels like forever, thinking in blocks really helped when working with so many different components. I hope you enjoy this site as much as I do!

Best,

Django Behunin
