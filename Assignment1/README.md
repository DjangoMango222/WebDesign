# Death of A Blue Movie Star

## A Novel by Jeffery Deaver

<p>This novel is simply a beautiful masterpiece. Jeffery Deaver wrote this book in the beginnning of his writting career and it is truly spectacular. It is by far one of my favorite novels and is truly in essence very unique and provoking. There is nothing more that I love then sitting down and reading a good true crime mystery.</p>
